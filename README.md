A fantasy football draft guide app, giving recommendations based on marginal value from ADP and projected performance from a number of different sources.

Inspired by that spreadsheet some awesome guy loads onto Reddit every year.  Projects the projected marginal loss of passing on the top projected performer at a given position right now.  Gets a best guess of how many at a given position are going to be selected between now and your next pick, and the project difference in total season points.

There are a few areas I want to work on improving.  First, I want to give simple, powerful means of configuring the data that factor into their projections.  I'd also like to factor in different injuries, and give the user the power to change how this is weighted.  More importantly, I'd like to simplify the user experience in responding to a live draft - as finding each player in a draft with autodraft can get really rough.
